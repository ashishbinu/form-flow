Sure, I can provide you with a sample set of API endpoints for creating forms, getting forms, and submitting forms with answers. These endpoints assume that you are using a RESTful API design. Please note that this is a simplified example, and you may need to adapt it to your specific programming language and framework.

1. **Create Form Endpoint (POST):**

   - URL: `/api/v1/forms`
   - Method: POST
   - Description: This endpoint allows the team to create a new form by sending a JSON body containing the form details.

   Request Body Example:

   ```json
   {
     "title": "Survey",
     "description": "Survey of your personal interests",
     "questions": [
       {
         "type": "text",
         "text": "What is your name?",
         "required": true
       },
       {
         "type": "text",
         "text": "What is your age?",
         "required": true
       },
       {
         "type": "radio",
         "text": "What is your favorite color?",
         "options": ["Red", "Blue", "Green", "Other"]
       },
       {
         "type": "text",
         "text": "Please provide your feedback:",
         "required": true
       },
       {
         "type": "checkbox",
         "text": "Select your interests:",
         "options": ["Sports", "Movies", "Reading", "Travel"]
       }
       // Add more questions as needed
     ]
   }
   ```

   Response:

   - 201 Created: The form has been successfully created, and the response may include the newly created form's ID.

2. **Get Form by ID Endpoint (GET):**

   - URL: `/api/v1/forms/{id}`
   - Method: GET
   - Description: This endpoint allows users to retrieve a specific form by its ID.

   Response Example:

   ```json
