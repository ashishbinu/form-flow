  - List of Questions (linked by Question IDs)

- **Questions:**

  - Question ID
  - Question Text
  - Question Type (e.g., text, MCQ)
  - Metadata (e.g., order in the form)

- **Responses:**

  - Response ID
  - Form ID (reference)
  - Responder ID (if applicable)
  - Metadata (e.g., submission date)
  - List of Answer IDs (linked by Answer IDs)

- **Answers:**
  - Answer ID
  - Question ID (reference)
  - Answer Text
  - Metadata (e.g., validation status)

**2. Google Sheets Integration:**

To enable seamless integration with Google Sheets:

- Implement an API endpoint that allows the client to trigger data export to Google Sheets.
- Use Google Sheets API for programmatic interactions.
- Map form responses to rows and questions to columns in Google Sheets.
- Set up periodic exports or allow users to trigger exports manually.

**3. Post-submission Business Logic:**

To support various post-submission business logic, consider implementing a plugin-based system:

- Create a plugin framework that allows clients to develop custom business logic plugins.
- Plugins can be written in a specific programming language (e.g., Python, JavaScript) and executed in a sandboxed environment.
- Define standardized interfaces for plugins to interact with the response data.
- Implement a queuing system to process plugins asynchronously.

**4. SMS Notification Integration:**

For sending SMS notifications after data ingestion:

- Integrate with an SMS gateway service (e.g., Twilio) using their APIs.
- Use the response data to dynamically generate SMS content.
- Implement a queuing system to ensure reliable delivery and handle retries.

**5. Scalability and Resilience:**

- Host the system on a cloud platform like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud to easily scale resources as needed.
- Implement auto-scaling policies based on traffic patterns.
- Use distributed databases to handle large volumes of data.
- Deploy redundant instances in different availability zones for fault tolerance.
- Implement data replication and backup strategies.

**6. Eventual Consistency:**

- Use asynchronous processing for data ingestion and business logic.
- Implement a message broker (e.g., RabbitMQ or Apache Kafka) for reliable message delivery.
- Ensure idempotency for processing messages to handle retries without side effects.

**7. Monitoring and Alerting:**

- Implement comprehensive logging at all levels of the application, including API endpoints, data processing, and integrations.
- Use centralized logging solutions like ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or cloud-native options.
- Set up health checks and monitoring for system components (e.g., database health, server health).
- Use cloud platform-specific monitoring services (e.g., AWS CloudWatch, Azure Monitor).
- Configure alerting based on predefined thresholds or anomalies.

**8. Benchmarking:**

- Use load testing tools like Apache JMeter or Locust to simulate high volumes of form submissions.
- Measure system performance, including response times and resource utilization.
- Identify bottlenecks and optimize as needed.
- Conduct stress testing to determine system limits.

**9. Third-party Limitations:**

- Research and document limitations of third-party services like Google Sheets (e.g., rate limits, data size restrictions).
- Implement error handling and retry mechanisms for third-party integrations.
- Keep track of API usage to avoid unexpected costs.

**10. Disaster Recovery:**

- Implement data backups and disaster recovery plans to recover from catastrophic failures.
- Regularly test and update the disaster recovery plan.

This architecture provides a foundation for handling various post-submission business logic scenarios and ensures scalability, resilience, and monitoring. It allows for future plug-and-play additions of new use cases while maintaining system integrity. Regularly reviewing and updating the architecture as new technologies and best practices emerge is crucial to long-term success.
