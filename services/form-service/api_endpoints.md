Sure, I can provide you with a sample set of API endpoints for creating forms, getting forms, and submitting forms with answers. These endpoints assume that you are using a RESTful API design. Please note that this is a simplified example, and you may need to adapt it to your specific programming language and framework.

In this response format:

- `"form"` contains the details of the associated form, including its title, description, and an array of questions.
- Each question object in the `"questions"` array includes details about the question and its associated answer. The `"answer"` field within each question provides information about the type of answer and the actual answer value.

This format allows you to provide a comprehensive view of the response, including the associated questions and their answers in a nested structure. Adjust the output format as needed to suit your specific requirements and frontend consumption.
